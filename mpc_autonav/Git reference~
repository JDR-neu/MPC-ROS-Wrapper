$ git clone gogs@gogs.mines.edu:M3Robotics/repo.git
repo - GeoBot, MPC, CodeBase, FlyingUnderground
- Clones the repo you want into your home/username/ folder

$ git status
- Checks the status of your repo

$ git branch
- Checks which branch you are in currently

$ git checkout ($branch-name)
- Switches to the specified branch name

$ git add file/path/folderToAdd*
- adds the specified folder 

$ git add /file/path/file.file
- adds the specified file to changes

$ git add -u
- adds all the updates (I use it to add deleted file updates)

$ git commit -m " Whatever you have changed"
- Adds the comment for the commit

***The add command should always be followed up by the commit for it to make sense.
***Always good practice to individually commit files so that you can add the commit along with it.

$ git push [remote] [branch-name]
remote - origin (default remote for our repo)
branch-name - Self-explanatory
- pushes the committed changes to the online repo. Can only be done if all the changes are committed and tracked.

$ git rm file/path/file.file
- removes the specified file from the local copy

$ git rm -r file/path*
- recursive removal for all the files in the folder
